    <h1>Welcome to Konaste API</h1>
    <p>
      This tool provides a number of browser sources that can provide
      information about Sound Voltex Konaste to enhance your stream. This
      project is currently considered to be in an alpha state. For any
      enquiries, suggestions or assistance, please {" "}
      <a href="https://github.com/konaste-tools/konaste-obs-sources/issues">open an issue</a>
      {" "} or contact Bauxe on Discord.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>1. Start konaste-api</h3>
      <p>
        konaste-api is a zero-setup server that runs on whichever computer Sound
        Voltex is running on. This will create a locally running server on port
        4573. To verify that the server is running, navigate to{" "}
        <a href="http://localhost:4573">http://localhost:4573</a>.
        <br />
        Note that you can access this on your local network by using your
        computer's local IP, or from outside of your local network if you set up
        port forwarding appropriately.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Setup your OBS sources</h3>
      <div>
        These should roughly correlate to important views in Sound Voltex, such
        as while playing a song (UI_SONG_PLAY) or at the song select screen
        (UI_SONG_SELECT). For a full list of available UIs, see
        models/info/GameWindow.kt
      </div>
      <h3>3. Configure konaste-obs-sources</h3>
      <p>
        If you only plan to use the data-source endpoints, you only need to
        configure the <b>API host</b>
        property. If you wish to make use of the OBS WebSocket capabilities, be
        sure to enable WebSocket Server in OBS and configure accordingly.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="[&_a]:underline [&_a]:text-blue-500">
      <h2>Endpoints</h2>
      <p>
        All data-providing endpoints include a corresponding test endpoint
        intended to help you verify the display in OBS. To use these endpoints,
        simply prepend "/test". For example, "/test/gameplay/nowplaying/radar"
        will provide a simulated radar page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/config">/config</a>
        <br />
        Provides a central location to configure your app settings. To configure
        within OBS, add this page as a browser source, right click the source
        and select <b>Interact</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/obs">/obs</a>
        <br />
        Opens a WebSocket connection to OBS and konaste-api to control scene
        display based on in-game UI. For this, you must enable websockets in OBS
        (<b>Tools -&gt; WebSocket Server Settings</b>) and configure OBS
        settings in <a href="/config">/config</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/gameplay/nowplaying/song">/gameplay/nowplaying/song</a>
        <br />
        If actively playing a song, will return the current song name and
        artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/gameplay/nowplaying/jacket">/gameplay/nowplaying/jacket</a>
        <br />
        If actively playing a song, will return the jacket. Pass the `size`
        query parameter, `small`, `normal` or `big` to control the jacket size.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/gameplay/nowplaying/radar">/gameplay/nowplaying/radar</a>
        <br />
        If actively playing a song, will return a radar for the song.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="/gameplay/score">/gameplay/score</a>
        <br />
        Opens a WebSocket connection konaste-api to emit live play data.
      </p>
