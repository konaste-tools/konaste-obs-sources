    <h1>Configuring Websockets</h1>
    <div>
      Due to the everchanging landscape of browser security features, it can
      often be a challenge to reliably load content over insecure streams (HTTP
      instead of HTTPS, WS instead of WSS, etc). This page outlines a number of
      options you have for successfully connecting to the OBS WebSocket as well
      as the konaste-api WebSockets.
    </div>
    <h2>Option 1: Adjust OBS security settings</h2>
    <div>
      This option is the most hands-off, however it also comes with a more
      substantial risk when compared with other options. Under the hood, OBS
      browser sources are effectively running Chromium. For this reason, we are
      able to configure the security settings that back the browser.
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a new OBS shortcut. You can typically find the executable at
          "C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe". Simply right-click
          the executable, click "Show more options" if you are running Windows
          11, and then click "Create Shortcut".
        </li>
        <li>
          Open the shortcut's properties by right clicking and selecting
          "Properties". Append " --allow-running-insecure-content" to the end of
          the "Target" field.
        </li>
        <li>
          Launch OBS using this shortcut going forward. Note that this will
          apply for all your browser sources. This will mostly just allow your
          browser to load HTTP and WS content in a HTTPS context. Be sensible
          with your browser sources and there is no risk :)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Option 2: Run this website locally</h2>
      <div>
        Browsers typically only apply security settings to websites hosted away
        from your computer. This means that by hosting this website on your own
        local PC, you will be able to avoid chrome's security settings without
        globally disabling your security settings.
        <br />
        This assumes you have an understanding of Git and know how to run
        webapps locally. If you do not, you can find plenty of resources online.
        Alternatively, you can try another option.
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clone or download the repository from
            https://github.com/Chris-SG/konaste-obs-sources
          </li>
          <li>
            Install{" "}
            <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install">yarn</a> if
            you have not yet
          </li>
          <li>
            Run "yarn && yarn dev" to start the server. Your terminal will
            provide the URL.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Option 3: Use an external browser for websocket connections</h2>
      <div>
        Browsers allow you to disable security features through settings. As
        Firefox only allows Mixed Content at a global context, using Chrome for
        this purpose is recommended and is what will be explained.
        <br />
        This requires that you use your browser as an OBS source instead of a
        Browser Source.
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Optionally create a new Chrome profile specifically for your
            sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigate to this page (
            <a href="https://konaste.bauxe.com/">https://konaste.bauxe.com/</a>
            ).
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternatively, click{" "}
            <a href="chrome://settings/content/siteDetails?site=https%3A%2F%2Fkonaste.bauxe.dev">
              here
            </a>{" "}
            to access the site settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the info box to the left of the URL bar, and choose "Site
            Settings".
          </li>
          <li>Change "Insecure Content" to "Allow".</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </>
);
